# _{Band Tracker}_

##### _{An App to manage bands, venues and buy tickets}, {28. August 2015}_

#### By _**{Christoph Pirringer}**_

## Feedback Request
_{I can not find the reason, why my integration-specs for the venues fail or how i can prevent the entries from building up over multiple tests in the ticket-path of the integration_specs. Information on how it should have been done would be greatly appreciated._}


## Description

_{The app allows you to enter bands along with their own relative ticket-prices (unless it's Nickelback. the App refuses to take Nickelback, it's cool that way). For display on the bands-list, the name of the band will be capitalized and displayed along its price.
Similarly one can enter a venue including a markup specific to that place.
On the pages for the single bands or venues, the relative relationships (a.k.a. "will play there") are displayed, along with a link to buy the specific ticket.
On the ticket-counter-page, the price for the ticket is calculated and displayed & the user is given the choice to buy the ticket or to abort.}_
